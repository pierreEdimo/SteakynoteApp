## General Information
I was in need to have a simple to use note taking application. So i decided to 
develop steakynote for myself. I use Flutter and Flutter Hive for the database.
It makes the application very limited, but it has all the basics features any 
note taking application should have.

## Technologies Used
- Flutter - version 2.2.2 - free, the sdk to develop a cross-platform application
- Hive - a lightweight NoSql database to store key value



## Features
- Create a new Book(Inside a so called book you can add different notes) 
- Edit the created  book
- delete the created book
- Create notes inside a book
- edit notes
- preview the formated note through a Markdown widget
- delete notes
- search for notes with the help of flutter search delegate
